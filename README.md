# WoW Soft Reserve Tracker

## What Is It?

**WoW Soft Reserve Tracker** is a fun and practical web app designed to make your World of Warcraft raids a little bit smoother. It helps guild members and PUGs (Pick-Up Group players) manage item reservations and track their raid attendance. You can reserve those shiny loot drops and keep track of your progress with ease â€” no more confusion, just loot!

## Key Features

- **Register Your Character:** Link your WoW character to the app so we know who you are and what you're after.
- **Reserve Loot:** Reserve items ahead of time for raids â€” get your hands on those precious drops.
- **Track Attendance:** Mark your attendance for raids and keep tabs on how you're doing with your reserves.
- **Real-Time Updates:** (Coming soon!) Weâ€™ll soon have live updates for reserved items and attendance, so youâ€™re always in the loop.

## Technologies

### Backend
- **Node.js** â€“ For building the server-side magic and handling everything behind the scenes.
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ Where we store all your data â€” like your character info and raid history.
- **Express** â€“ The framework that keeps everything nice and tidy on the server side.

### Frontend
- **Vanilla JavaScript** â€“ Pure JS, no frameworks here! All DOM rendering and logic is powered by the simplicity of vanilla JS.
- **JQuery** â€“ Helping with DOM manipulation and AJAX calls to make everything run smoothly.
- **Bootstrap** â€“ To make sure the app looks great and functions smoothly.
- **Parcel** â€“ Our bundler of choice for a super fast, zero-config build.
- **Polyfilling** â€“ Weâ€™ve got you covered with compatibility for older browsers too!
